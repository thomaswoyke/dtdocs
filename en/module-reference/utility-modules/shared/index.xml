      <description>Filter the images shown in the lighttable view and filmstrip panel using image attributes. This set of filtered images is known as a collection.
Importing images into darktable stores information about them (filename, path, Exif data, data from XMP sidecar files etc.) in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database. A collection may be defined by applying filtering rules to these attributes, thus creating a subset of images to display in the lighttable view and the filmstrip module.</description>

      <description>Export selected images.
When used in the darkroom view, the currently-edited image will be exported if no other images are selected in the filmstrip.
Files can be exported to a file on disk, email, various online storage locations, a web album, or a book template.
🔗module controls 🔗storage options  target storage The type of location to store your selected images. A number of different back-ends are implemented, including file on disk, LaTeX book template and various web albums.</description>

      <description>The filmstrip can be used to quickly switch between images in any darktable view. The images shown are the same as those displayed in the lighttable view and are defined by the currently-selected collection.
  The filmstrip can be switched on and off using the shortcut Ctrl+F. The height of the filmstrip panel can be changed by clicking and dragging its top border.
Quickly navigate through the images in the filmstrip by scrolling with the mouse.</description>

      <description>Identify which parts of the image contain sharp edges, which usually indicates that those areas are in focus.
Activate the module by clicking on the  icon. The sharp parts of the image will be highlighted with a yellow, green and blue overlay:
Focus peaking works by filtering out image noise, measuring the intensity gradients in the image and calculating average and standard deviation statistics. When the gradient of an edge differs significantly from the mean, the associated pixels are marked with a &amp;ldquo;heat map&amp;rdquo; indicating how sharp the edge is.</description>

      <description>Import and apply GPX track data to a selection of images.
This module is common to the lighttable and map views. The map view provides an enhanced mode that allows you to preview the position of the images along the GPS tracks while adjusting the images&#39; date/time offset and time zone.
🔗workflow overview A GPS receiver calculates its current position based on information it receives from satellites, and records it in a GPX file together with the current date and time.</description>

      <description>Display information embedded within an image&amp;rsquo;s Exif data as well as a number of additional data fields defined by darktable.
When hovering with the mouse over image thumbnails, the displayed data is automatically updated to show information about the image currently under the mouse cursor.
When several images are selected and the focus is not on a single image, the module only displays information that is the same for all images.</description>

      <description>Manage tags attached to images.
Tags provide a means of adding information to images using a keyword dictionary. You can also manage tags as a hierarchical tree, which can be useful when their number becomes large.
Tags are physically stored in XMP sidecar files as well as in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database and can be included in exported images.
🔗definitions The following definitions assume that you have set up a single tag named &amp;ldquo;places|France|Nord|Lille&amp;rdquo;.</description>
