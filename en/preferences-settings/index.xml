      <description>darktable comes with a number of user-configurable preferences. These can be adjusted in the preferences dialog, which can be reached by clicking the gear icon on the right of the top panel. Preferences are separated into tabs, each of which is described in more detail in the following sections.
When opened from within the lighttable or darkroom views, the appropriate tab will be loaded by default to allow you to modify that view&amp;rsquo;s settings.</description>

      <description>Control the overall look and feel of darktable.
 interface language Set the language of the user interface. The system default is marked with an * (needs a restart) theme Set the theme for the user interface. Aside from any aesthetic considerations, the recommended interface color for color evaluation is middle gray. Visual perception is affected by ambient brightness, and a low user interface brightness causes all kinds of illusions. Using a dark interface to retouch photos can therefore lead to excessive retouching (abuse of contrast and saturation) and to a photo that is too dark when printed.</description>

      <description>Control default file naming conventions used when importing images.
üîósession options The following options define the default naming pattern for use in the &amp;ldquo;copy &amp;amp; import&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;copy &amp;amp; import from camera&amp;rdquo; options in the import module, or when taking photos in the tethering view.
The naming pattern consists of three parts: a base part defining the parent folder, a session part defining a sub directory (which is specific to the individual import session), and a file name part defining the filename structure for each imported image.</description>

üîógeneral  pen pressure control for brush masks Controls how the pressure reading of a graphics tablet impacts newly generated drawn mask brush strokes. You can control the brush width, hardness and opacity. ‚ÄúAbsolute‚Äù control means that the pressure reading directly defines the attribute with a value between 0% and 100%. ‚ÄúRelative‚Äù means that the pressure reading adjusts the attribute between zero and the pre-defined default value (default off).</description>

      <description>Control how images are processed.
üîóimage processing  always use LittleCMS 2 to apply output color profile If this option is activated, darktable will use the LittleCMS 2 system library to apply the output color profile instead of its own internal routines. This is significantly slower than the default but might give more accurate results in some cases.  If the given ICC is LUT-based or contains both a LUT and a matrix, darktable will use LittleCMS 2 to render the colors regardless of this parameter&amp;rsquo;s value (default off).</description>
