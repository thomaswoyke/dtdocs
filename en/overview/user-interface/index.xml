      <description>The layout of all darktable views is similar and consists of a center area with panels at the edges:
    center area : Contains information and functionality specific to the current view.
  left panel : Contains modules primarily used to provide information.
  right panel : Contains modules primarily used for image processing.
  top banner : Contains information about the current darktable version and allows you to switch between views.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/overview/user-interface/filmstrip/</guid>
      <description>The filmstrip, when enabled, is shown at the bottom of the screen (except in the lighttable view, where it is replaced with the timeline module) and displays the images from the current collection (set in the lighttable view). You can navigate the filmstrip by scrolling with the mouse wheel.
The filmstrip allows you to interact with images while you are not in the lighttable view. For example, while developing an image in darkroom mode, you can switch to another image to by clicking its thumbnail in the filmstrip.</description>
